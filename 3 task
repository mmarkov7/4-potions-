The mices can smell the poison i will mark each potion with number 1,2,3,4. I will give each potion before the mices to smell it, if the mices want to drink from the potion it's not poisonous.
When I spot wich potion is poisonous I will water a plant with it, if the plant dies i will be sure that this is the right potion.
